**The concept of The Habitat** is as simple as being a home for all performers.
A home that has everything available to make it comfortable for all to create, experiment, test out their work, re-work, record and be able to present in an environment that is receptive and welcoming.
A home that promotes collaboration between Artists, Performers, Musicians, Stand Up Comedians, Poets, Theatrical Acts, Technicians to create the most conducive environment for growth and learning along with mutually beneficial encounters.
In short - collaboration that generates good vibes.
A great atmosphere like that coupled with foodgasm inducing comfort food that will keep anyone mesmerised, enthralled.
